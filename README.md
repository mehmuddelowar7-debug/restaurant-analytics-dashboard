# Restaurant Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
The **Restaurant Analytics Dashboard** is an interactive business analytics project designed to simulate how analytics teams support **pricing, operations, and growth decisions** in food delivery platforms.  

Developed independently as part of my **MBA (Final Year) portfolio**, this project demonstrates applied skills in **data analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling**, transforming transactional order-level data into actionable insights.

## 🔹 Filters & Prediction Inputs
- **City & Subzone Selection:** Analyze performance at different geographic levels.  
- **Delivery Type Filter:** Compare dine-in, take-away, and delivery orders.  
- **Date Range Selection:** Track trends over time.  
- **Predict Order Total Inputs:**  
  - Number of items  
  - Total discount (₹)  
  - Kitchen Preparation Time (KPT) in minutes  
  - Rider wait time in minutes  
  - Delivery delay in minutes  

---

## 🍽️ Dashboard & Analytics
Designed to simulate **decision-support analytics for restaurant operations**:  
- Interactive dashboards with maps and charts  
- KPI monitoring for **revenue, order counts, and discounts**  
- Scenario-based predictions to test operational changes  

---

## 🎯 Business Context & Objective
- Monitor revenue performance and operational efficiency  
- Understand customer behavior and order trends  
- Evaluate factors that influence order value  
- Demonstrate the application of **data-driven insights and predictive modeling** in a real-world food delivery ecosystem  

---

## 📌 Data Scope & Assumptions
- Historical order-level data sourced from structured datasets  
- Geographic coordinates are synthetically generated for visualization  
- All monetary values are in Indian Rupees (₹)  
- Predictions and KPIs are intended for **analytical demonstration** and not live operations  
- Operational time variables (KPT, rider wait, delivery delay) are modeled features for demonstration purposes

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators
| KPI | Value | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Total Revenue (₹) | 14,554,058.14 | Overall business volume |
| Average Order Total (₹) | 682.62 | Assess pricing and customer spend |
| Total Orders | 21,321 | Demand intensity |
| Average Discount (₹) | 12.57 | Promotional dependency and margin impact |

---

## 🎯 Key Business Takeaways
- High-revenue restaurants achieve more through **average order value** than higher order counts  
- Discounts remain low, suggesting **limited margin erosion**  
- Order volume trends help **optimize staffing and rider allocation**  
- Subzone-level revenue differences support **targeted promotions**  
- Predictive estimates allow scenario testing for **operational improvements or promotional strategies**  

---

## 🚀 Recommended Business Actions
- Focus marketing investments on **high-performing subzones**  
- Optimize menu pricing and bundling for restaurants with **high average order value**  
- Use order volume trends to **proactively plan kitchen and rider staffing**  
- Monitor KPT sensitivity to identify kitchens where **efficiency improvements can increase revenue**  
- Evaluate financial impact of **promotional strategies** using predictive modeling  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- **Restaurant Insights:** Compare rating, orders, and revenue  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Random Forest regression predicts expected order value based on operational inputs  
- **Scenario Testing:** Supports decision-making rather than exact financial forecasting  

---

## ⚠️ Model Disclaimer
Predictions are based on historical data patterns and may vary under changing operational conditions. They should be used as **decision-support estimates** only.

## 👤 Project Context & Ownership
This dashboard was **conceptualized, designed, and implemented independently** as part of my MBA (Final Year) portfolio.  

Key focus areas:  
- Revenue and order volume analysis  
- Discount impact evaluation  
- Restaurant and city-level performance comparison  
- Subzone-wise revenue distribution  
- Predictive modeling for order value estimation  

> Focus is on **analytical reasoning, business insights, and scenario simulation**, rather than production-grade system deployment.
